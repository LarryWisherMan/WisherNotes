## Trading and Processing

### Message Trading

- **Inbound Flows**: Partners → Application
- **Outbound Flows**: Application → Partners
- Trading can involve packaging and encryption of messages.
- Processes involving consumption and delivery are managed by the B2Bi Trading engine.

### Message Processing

- Managed by the integration engine, which handles the transformation of messages between formats.
- Creates and sends business-level acknowledgments.
- Processing can be applied to all consumed messages.

## B2Bi Objects

### Communities

- Local way of grouping trading partners.
- Defines the organization’s internal processes for handling messages.
- Defines how the community expects to receive messages from applications and remote partners.
- The community can be assigned the role of sender or receiver in agreements.
- To exchange messages, you must define a community, Trading Pickup, Partner Delivery and Partner

  <p className="image-caption">Figure 2: B2Bi Object Flow</p>

### Partners

- Object that represents a sender or receiver.
- Message processing definitions are called **agreements**.
- Can exist without being associated with a community
- Can also be associated with multiple communities.
- Partners must belong to a community for trading to occur.
- Partners associated with a community for message exchanges are **trading partners**.

## Objects for Message Processing

### Metadata Profile

- Used to trigger processing based on the attributes of messages
- messages are evaluated for metadata content and processing is applied based on the metadata profile defined.
- meta data profiles are used to specify message processing based only on one or more metadata attributes

:::note Manage Profiles
To create and manage profiles **Processing Configuration > Manage metadata profiles**
:::

### Agreements

- Used to specify how B2Bi processes information that is exchanged between two or more trading endpoints.
- based on standards-based type of processing for X12, EDIFACT, etc.
- Agreements are used to specify the types of documents that can be exchanged and the processing rules that apply to those documents.

:::note Manage Agreements
To view, add and manage agreements you select **Processing configuration > Manage
agreements to open the Agreements page.**
:::

#### Types of Agreements

Agreements define one of two types of trading exchanges

1. **Inbound**

   - defines characteristics of an exchange from a application or remote partner
   - Settings are used to match the incoming messages based on information in the Identification tab of the inbound agreement
   - Information in the _Document Agreements_ tab is used to define the appropriate processing

1. **Outbound**

   - Defines the enveloping required for sending to a application or remote partner

#### Types of Endpoint Participant Relationships

Agreements may define the endpoint participants in several ways:

| Relationship Type                                | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explicit sender/receiver relationship**        | Only a specific messaging identifier for a partner or community is valid. |
| **Implicit sender/receiver relationship**        | Any messaging identifier for a partner or community is valid.             |
| **Semi-anonymous partner**                       | Either the sender or the receiver is undefined.                           |
| **Fully-anonymous sender/receiver relationship** | Both trading participants (sender and receiver) are undefined.            |

### Services

- Used to specify processing sequence for handling a message exchanged between two or more partners
- Two types of Services:
  1. **Metadata Services** <br/>
     Used in the context of metadata profiles
  1. **Partner Services** <br/>
     used in the context of agreements
- Each component defines a step in the processing of a message
- Can be reused in multiple agreements and by multiple metadata profiles

:::note Manage Services
Create and manage service objects in the **Processing configuration > Manage services page.**
:::

### Components

- Provides specific types of processing to a message handling flow
- Components associates a resource with a set of parameters and message formats
- Processing can then be used in one or more service objects to specify how a message type is handled between two or more exchange endpoints
- Used when you want to use the functionality provided by a resource to process a message exchanged between endpoints

:::note Manage Components
create and edit components in the **Processing configuration > Manage components page.**
:::

#### Component Types

| Component                 | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enveloper**             | Adds an envelope to a document or group of documents for outbound messages, including sender and receiver IDs. |
| **Detector**              | Detects characteristics of messages in B2Bi.                                                                   |
| **Post detection**        | Processes a message after detection but before any message processing, e.g., splitting or mapping.             |
| **Map**                   | Transforms messages, performs data mining, and routes based on message body, header, or metadata.              |
| **Custom Delivery**       | Used with application delivery to send messages to a database or external application.                         |
| **Document**              | Performs regular document processing, executed after a map but before enveloping.                              |
| **Post enveloping**       | Provides processing after the enveloping of outbound messages.                                                 |
| **Post transfer success** | Specific post-processing after a successful transfer.                                                          |
| **Post transfer failed**  | Specific post-processing after a failed transfer attempt.                                                      |
