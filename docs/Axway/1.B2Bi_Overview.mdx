## Trading and Processing

### Message Trading

- **Inbound Flows**: Partners → Application
- **Outbound Flows**: Application → Partners
- Trading can involve packaging and encryption of messages.
- Processes involving consumption and delivery are managed by the B2Bi Trading engine.

### Message Processing

- Managed by the integration engine, which handles the transformation of messages between formats.
- Creates and sends business-level acknowledgments.
- Processing can be applied to all consumed messages.

### Message Trading Sequence

1. The Message is consumed
1. The Trading Engine Decrypts the message
1. The Integration Engine uncompresses the payload
1. The Integration Engine processes the payload
1. The Content is enveloped
1. The Message is signed and Encrypted
1. The Message is Delivered

## B2Bi Objects

### Communities

- Local way of grouping trading partners.
- Defines Trading and Security Context
- Defines the organization’s internal processes for handling messages.
- Defines how the community expects to receive messages from applications and remote partners.
- The community can be assigned the role of sender or receiver in agreements.
- To exchange messages, you must define a community, Trading Pickup, Partner Delivery and Partner
- Stores the partners' root certificates

  <p className="image-caption">Figure 2: B2Bi Object Flow</p>

### Partners

- Object that represents a sender or receiver.
- Can be a division of your company abroad
- Interacts with a community using a specific protocols and standards
- Message processing definitions are called **agreements**.
- Can exist without being associated with a community
- Can also be associated with multiple communities.
- Partners must belong to a community for trading to occur.
- Partners associated with a community for message exchanges are **trading partners**.

### Trading Pickup

- Defines the protocol, transport, and security settings for receiving messages
- On This object you set the message processing mode (limited or standard)

## Objects for Message Processing

### Metadata Profile

- Used to trigger processing based on the attributes of messages
- messages are evaluated for metadata content and processing is applied based on the metadata profile defined.
- meta data profiles are used to specify message processing based only on one or more metadata attributes

:::note Manage Profiles
To create and manage profiles **Processing Configuration > Manage metadata profiles**
:::

### Agreements

- Used to specify how B2Bi processes information that is exchanged between two or more trading endpoints.
- based on standards-based type of processing for X12, EDIFACT, etc.
- Agreements are used to specify the types of documents that can be exchanged and the processing rules that apply to those documents.

:::note Manage Agreements
To view, add and manage agreements you select **Processing configuration > Manage
agreements to open the Agreements page.**
:::

#### Types of Agreements

Agreements define one of two types of trading exchanges

1. **Inbound**

   - defines characteristics of an exchange from a application or remote partner
   - Settings are used to match the incoming messages based on information in the Identification tab of the inbound agreement
   - Information in the _Document Agreements_ tab is used to define the appropriate processing

1. **Outbound**

   - Defines the enveloping required for sending to a application or remote partner

#### Types of Endpoint Participant Relationships

Agreements may define the endpoint participants in several ways:

| Relationship Type                                | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explicit sender/receiver relationship**        | Only a specific messaging identifier for a partner or community is valid. |
| **Implicit sender/receiver relationship**        | Any messaging identifier for a partner or community is valid.             |
| **Semi-anonymous partner**                       | Either the sender or the receiver is undefined.                           |
| **Fully-anonymous sender/receiver relationship** | Both trading participants (sender and receiver) are undefined.            |

### Services

- Used to specify processing sequence for handling a message exchanged between two or more partners
- Two types of Services:
  1. **Metadata Services** <br/>
     Used in the context of metadata profiles
  1. **Partner Services** <br/>
     used in the context of agreements
- Each component defines a step in the processing of a message
- Can be reused in multiple agreements and by multiple metadata profiles

<p className="image-caption">Figure 3: Service Flow</p>

:::note Manage Services
Create and manage service objects in the **Processing configuration > Manage services page.**
:::

### Components

- Each component defines a step in the processing of the message
- Provides specific types of processing to a message handling flow
- Components associates a resource with a set of parameters and message formats
- Processing can then be used in one or more service objects to specify how a message type is handled between two or more exchange endpoints
- Used when you want to use the functionality provided by a resource to process a message exchanged between endpoints

:::note Manage Components
create and edit components in the **Processing configuration > Manage components page.**
:::

### Resource

- A piece of message processing code residing in the integration engine

#### Resource Types

| Component                 | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enveloper**             | Adds an envelope to a document or group of documents for outbound messages, including sender and receiver IDs. |
| **Detector**              | Detects characteristics of messages in B2Bi.                                                                   |
| **Post detection**        | Processes a message after detection but before any message processing, e.g., splitting or mapping.             |
| **Map**                   | Transforms messages, performs data mining, and routes based on message body, header, or metadata.              |
| **Custom Delivery**       | Used with application delivery to send messages to a database or external application.                         |
| **Document**              | Performs regular document processing, executed after a map but before enveloping.                              |
| **Post enveloping**       | Provides processing after the enveloping of outbound messages.                                                 |
| **Post transfer success** | Specific post-processing after a successful transfer.                                                          |
| **Post transfer failed**  | Specific post-processing after a failed transfer attempt.                                                      |
